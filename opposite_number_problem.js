function opposite(number) {
    return (number * -1);
  }
  
/* To solve this one, you have to get the function to output the opposite of all the integers and floating-point numbers in the sample tests. I found that the easiest way to do this is to simply multiply those numbers by -1 since that will flip those values to their negative versions the same way that those numbers multiplied by 1 will just output the positive versions of those values! */
